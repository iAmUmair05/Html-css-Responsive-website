        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">The first correspondence courses began in the 1800s using parcel post to reach students who couldn't be on a university campus. By the early 1900s, communication technologies improved and distance education took to the radio waves.
            <br><br>In 1919 professors at the <a href="#">University of Wisconsin</a> began an amateur radio station, becoming the first licensed radio station dedicated to educational broadcasting. Soon after, access to higher <a>education</a> was again expanded through the invention of the television; giving birth to what was known as the telecourse.
            <br>The University of Iowa began to experiment with television for educational purposes in the 1930s.

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">The well-known educational theorist John Dewey argued that learning occurs in collaboration with knowledgeable others. Similarly, psychologist <a href="#">Jean Piaget</a> noted that in order for learning to occur, the content must be meaningful to the student.
            <br><br>Piaget's constructivist theory of learning highlighted the importance of engaged learning where meaningful discussions were held between peers.[33] The sociologist Lev Vygotsky also emphasized the importance of social interaction in learning.</p>

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">he primary benefit of unemployment is that people are available for hire, without being headhunted away from their existing employers. That permits both new and old businesses to take on staff.<br>

Unemployment is argued to be "beneficial" to the people who are not unemployed in the sense that it averts inflation, which itself has damaging effects, by providing a reserve army of labour, which keeps wages in check.
<br><br>However, the direct connection between full local employment and local inflation has been disputed by some because of the recent increase in <a href="#">international</a> that supplies low-priced goods even while local employment rates rise to full employment.</p>
